# ArcGIS-API-for-Python
# This script reads in a feature layer of generators within California. It it intersects
# 		this layer with the polygon of District 7 (Los Angeles and Ventura Counties).
# 		I then load the result in a webmap in my organizational ArcGIS Online account.
# 		Ultimately, I would have liked to apply the same rendering or drawing info from the original
#		  data on to my new web map.
