# ArcGIS-API-for-Python
# This script reads in a feature layer of generators within California. It intersects this layer with the polygon of District 7 (Los Angeles and Ventura Counties). The result is loaded into a webmap in my organizational ArcGIS Online account. Ultimately, I would have liked to apply the same rendering or drawing info from the original data on to my new web map.
